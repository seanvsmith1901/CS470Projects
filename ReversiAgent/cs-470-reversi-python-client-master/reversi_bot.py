        The bot should take a game state and return a move.

        The parameter "state" is of type ReversiGameState and has two useful
        member variables. The first is "board", which is an 8x8 numpy array
        of 0s, 1s, and 2s. If a spot has a 0 that means it is unoccupied. If
        there is a 1 that means the spot has one of player 1's stones. If
        there is a 2 on the spot that means that spot has one of player 2's
        stones. The other useful member variable is "turn", which is 1 if it's
        player 1's turn and 2 if it's player 2's turn.

        ReversiGameState objects have a nice method called get_valid_moves.
        When you invoke it on a ReversiGameState object a list of valid
        moves for that state is returned in the form of a list of tuples.

        Move should be a tuple (row, col) of the move you want the bot to make.
        '''
        valid_moves = state.get_valid_moves()

        move = rand.choice(valid_moves) # Moves randomly...for now
        return move
